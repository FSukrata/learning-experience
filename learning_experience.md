I learned two courses in the last three days, such as: <br>
1. Memulai Dasar Pemrograman untuk Menjadi Pengembang Software
2. Pengenalan ke Logika Pemrograman (Programming Logic 101)

I got the certificate [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fDJstuHeY1UkcBFz509G_iq1lWVCXIeL?hl=ID)

From today's morning, I've been studying Git and GitHub course and I almost meet my study target plan. 

P.S
It's me at 3:55 PM WITA <br>
I made some porgress, and now, it's sitting about 39% done or about 22 materials that I learned, and <br> 
that doesn't include the Git Bash that I learned by myself for an hour.

I got bored with Dicoding tutorial showing me how to use it using GitHub GUI.
